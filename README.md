Tasks 👨‍💼

👨‍💼: You're the new developer finishing off the England Football Team Player Selector System (EFTPSS 🄒). A competitor has done most of it, but they've gone walkabout at the critical moment! Can you finish it please?

👨‍💼: On click of the button, the system chooses the next player to be called up to the England squad, ensuring complete fairness

When Phil Foden comes up, he doesn't have an emoji! Add an appropriate emoji for Phil (🐨: Look in static/names.js)

Add a button saying "Go to the tournament ⚽️" (💰: Use the button in components/Main.js to help)

💯 : When the user presses the tournament button, create an alert saying "Euro 2020, here we come 🤩"

💯 : Change the background colour to a royal red, with white text, to support the team

💯 : Add an image for each player, and render this on the page
